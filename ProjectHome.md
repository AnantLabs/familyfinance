# Introduction #
This is a finance program that implements the Envelope Budgeting System (Explanation at Project Main Website --> Introduction). It uses C# under the ADO.net framework and SQLce 3.1 as the underlying database.

One of the key features of this program (and the main motivation) is the use of the Envelope Budgeting System. With electronic forms of payment from debit cards, automatic deposits, and bill pay using real paper envelopes can become difficult.

This program allows you to keep track of all the transactions from several accounts (real or made-up) and keep an Envelope Budget on those accounts.
