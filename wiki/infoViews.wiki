From the Admin screen you are able to setup views. A view is how the program keeps accounts and envelopes grouped together correctly. For example You might want to setup a view called "Mom and Dad" and views for your children called "John" or "Mary". Then all accounts and envelopes setup within each view will be kept separate.



== User ==

The user is individual to each person that uses Family Finance. Continuing from the previous example Mom and Dad will log in with their separate user names Lori and Stan.



== Rights ==

A user will have either (A)dmin rights or (R)ead Only rights to a view. Lori and Stan will each want to Admin rights to the "Mom and Dad" view. Also Mary will have Admin rights to the "Mary" view and John will have Admin rights to the "John" view. As parents Lori and Stan might want to have Read Only rights to the "Mary" and "John" view so they can monitor their childrens' money activities.
